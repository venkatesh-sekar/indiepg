# Progress — hardening loop

Reverse-chronological. One prepended entry per iteration:
`## Iter #N — <date> — <mode>/<band> — <verdict>` then 1–3 lines of what/why.
Older entries get archived once this file grows large.

## Iter #1 — 2026-07-01 — P/backup (band 1 PITR) — SHIPPED

Restore now preflights the recovery target *before* any destructive step: a TIME
target earlier than the earliest available backup can never be reached (recovery
replays WAL forward from a base backup), so `preflightTargetReachable` refuses it
with a clear `CodeValidation` error that names the target + earliest backup —
instead of stopping the cluster, taking a safety backup, and only then letting
pgBackRest fail with an opaque error at the most data-critical moment. Fail-open
on uncertainty (nil/non-time target, `Info` error, or no usable backup start
time → proceed; pgBackRest stays the final arbiter). Tests drive the real
`Restore` path and assert NO stop/safety-backup/restore ran on rejection. Both
reviewers (code-reviewer + fail-fast critic) passed with no blocking findings;
added a non-TIME-scope test per the critic.

Also (priority-0, separate commit): gofmt-cleaned 3 pre-existing files
(internal/server/server.go + 2 e2e scenario files) that had drifted and were
failing the fmt gate — no behavior change.

Gates: fmt ✓ vet ✓ `go test ./...` ✓ static build ✓. Docker unavailable → e2e
skipped (future/xid target rejection needs a live cluster; tracked in backlog).
